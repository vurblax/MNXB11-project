- downloaded fast-csv-parser library

- created translation units for DataExtraction C++ script:
    - filled with test/skeleton code to make use of uncleaned data
    - updated makefile to include the library file

- created bash script to clean data files called cleaner.sh
- cleaned data files and put them in directory ./datasets/cleaned

- updated translation units for DataExtraction C++ script:
    - significant change; now script instead extracts cleaned data files. Also changed the name of some functions and variables to specify 'dataextraction' name instead of CSVparser something that was there before. Script now compiles, but the output of the extraction doesn't currently go anywhere.

- downloaded date library
- DataExtraction translation units updated: exctracts csv file into a TTree
  HOWEVER: while it compiles, ROOT does not recognise the date pointer.
  Code needs to be further updated. Issue probably lies with implementation
  of the date library.
- Started working on the WeatherData files 

Wed 25/10
- date variable divided into three integers
- time variable no longer using date library, instead the hour only is
  being extracted to the TTree as one integer
- data extraction now compiles without errors and gives correct output
