The first step was dowloading the library
Then we have to work on the data extraction together
Astrid works on the bash cleaner file
Marta and Vera works on the C++ extractor
once we have extracted the date we decided that we can do one analysis each (3 analysis)

1. downloading csv library for cleaning 
2. making a bash cleaner script (Astrid)
3. creating C++ code to extract the data:
    1) make it into a nice list, using library if possible? (Vera and Marta cowork monday)
    2) putting output into a TFile and a TTree so that we can work on it with ROOT
4. decide on analysis. who's doing what?
5. creating c++ code for each analysis, one analysis per person so three pairs of translation units that we work on separately
5. everyone creates nice graphs to put into LaTeX, write each results part individually
