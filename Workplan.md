Workplan, steps:
1. downloading csv library for cleaning (Vera and Marta cowork monday)
2. making a bash cleaner script (Astrid monday)
3. creating C++ code to extract the data:
    1) make it into a nice list, using library if possible? (Vera and Marta cowork monday)
    2) putting output into a TFile and a TTree so that we can work on it with ROOT (Vera, tuesday + wednesday)
update: part1 took longer than expected. data extraction finished on wednesday, although original plan was tuesday.
    3) creating a script to sort out bad quality data (Astrid, wednesday)
4. decide on analysis. who's doing what?
- Astrid: analysis 1 - the temperature of a given day
- Vera: analysis 2 - yearly mean temperatures
- Marta: analysis 3 - the warmest and coldest day of each year
5. creating c++ code for each analysis, one analysis per person so three pairs of translation units that we work on separately (thursday)
5. everyone creates nice graphs to put into LaTeX, write each results part individually. cowork on introduction, etc. (friday)
